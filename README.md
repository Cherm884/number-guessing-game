A simple but enhanced Number Guessing Game built using Python.

This version includes multiple rounds, a timer, hint system, and a difficulty-based high score tracker.

🚀 Features

✔ Three difficulty levels:

Easy → 10 chances

Medium → 5 chances

Hard → 3 chances
✔ Hint system (tells how close your guess is)
✔ Timer (how long it took you to win)
✔ High score tracker per difficulty
✔ Supports multiple rounds
✔ Fully CLI-based (runs in terminal)
